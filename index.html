    <h2 id="result1">First result</h2>
    <h2>"pi = 2; // "Uncaught TypeError: invalid assignment to const 'pi'" is the output. This is because "pi" is declared using the "const" keyword. This means that it is a constant and cannot be reassigned a new value after its initial declaration.</h2>
    <h2 id="result2">Second result</h2>
    <h2>"Math.min(3.14, Number(17)) = 3.14" is the output. This is because the Math.min function takes numerical values, converts myNumber to a number, 
        and finds the minimum value between 3.14 and 17, which is 3.14.</h2>
